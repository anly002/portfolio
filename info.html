                    When I first entered college, I was uncertain about the direction I wanted to take and had not yet discovered a passion beyond playing video games.
                    At the time, the only consistent source of enjoyment I found outside of gaming was watching anime, and I often felt relaxed and at peace when drawing characters from my favorite anime shows.
                    This interest led me to pursue digital art and declare Art as my major at community college. I enrolled in the required course and gradually developed a recognizable style that became evident across my drawings.
                    Although I am happy with the style I developed, I often struggled with anatomy. Without references, I found it difficult to accurately capture the human form, and while using references is common practice,
                    I felt it lessened the enjoyment of the creative process for me. Challenges such as shading, lighting, and designing backgrounds added to the difficulty.<br><br>This one particular time lapse drawing shown, however,
                    remains one of my favorite pieces. Unlike many of the other works, I felt genuinely satisfied with the outcome. I even managed to create a background-something I rarely attempted to due in my inexperience-which made
                    me especially proud. I remember relying on numerous references for thsi piece, and it became one of the most time-consuming projects I had ever completed. Despite the progress I could see in my work, I often felt
                    I was not advancing to the level I wanted. As a result, I draw less frequently and instead turned back to gaming, which at the time had became an addictive escape.

                    During my time in community college, my passion for gaming inspired me to build my own computer. Although I had prior experience assembling two systems, one man years earlier from watching a youtube video and another
                    for my cousin, this was my first time approaching the process independently and for myself so I had to do a lot of research for this. I initially budgeted $1,500 for my build and carefully selected quality components within
                    that range. While the computer I built was already above average, I soon realized I was unsatisfied with the limitations of my budget. Since I was working and had hte means to invest more, I regreted not building a system that
                    was fully future-proof from the start.<br><br>Driven by this, I built a second computer, this time spending close to $4,000 with fewer budget constraints. I am very satisfied with the current build, which I consider powerful enough
                    to last me for years. Through the process of building both PCs, I gained a deeper understanding of computer hardware and how components interact, this knowledge I primarily acquired through a lot of self-learning. I found this
                    exploration of technology not only fascinating but genuinely enjoyable. Although I was unable to formally pursue this field of study in school, I continue to expand my knowlege independently, particularily in areas such as hardware,
                    cicuitry, and embedded systems.

                    While pursuing an Art Major at community college with plans to transfer to a university, I continued to teach myself about computer hardware and technology. Being admitted to the University of California, San Diego was a turning
                    point for me, as it gave me as far more motivation than before. I hadn't expected to be accepted to any university, even as a transfer student. Upon entering UCSD, I switched my major to ICAM (Interdisciplinary Computing & Arts Major),
                    which aligned more closely with my growing interests.<br><br>Initially, I set out to explore web design and began working with Figma. However, I found the application's learning curve somewhat discouraging. At the same time, I took
                    coding classes in Python and Java, which sparked my curiosity about programming. With additional help from ChatGPT, I decided to shift toward coding websites directly. I found this approach much more enjoyable and intuitive than design
                    tools, which motivated me to continue building pojects on my own. Over time, I gained experience not only in front-end development but also in back-end concepts and databases, fueling my interest in becoming a full-stack developer. <br><br>
                    Today, I continue to learn and improve through independent projects while completing my undergraduate degree at UCSD, with hte goal of combining creativity and technical skills in my future career.
